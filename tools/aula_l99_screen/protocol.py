"""Image format for the AULA L99's touchscreen (EEEF:268A).

This is a *different device* from the keyboard's vendor HID channel: the panel
is a CDC-ACM USB-serial device appearing as /dev/ttyACMn, so none of the
`04 xx` command framing in aula_l99_hacky applies here.

The format was derived from the vendor's own converter, `Image2Bin.exe`
(shipped in `qt-tool/` alongside the Windows app), by feeding it known images
and decoding what it wrote:

    bytes 00..03   uint32 LE   payload size in bytes (width * height * 2)
    bytes 04..05   uint16 LE   width
    bytes 06..07   uint16 LE   height
    byte  08       0x00        constant in every sample
    bytes 09..10   uint16 LE   CRC16/MODBUS over the pixel data
    bytes 11..     pixels      RGB565, little-endian, row-major

Verified rather than assumed:
  - Pixel encoding checked against a known test image: its first pixel came
    back as 0x05BF, exactly RGB565 for the cyan (0,180,255) line drawn at y=0,
    and its last as 0x0845 for the (10,10,40) background.
  - The dimension fields are real, not constants: a 200x100 input produced a
    40011-byte file with width=200, height=100.
  - The checksum is CRC16/MODBUS little-endian, matching four samples across
    two image sizes. CRC16/ARC, CCITT, XMODEM, Kermit and plain byte/word sums
    were all tested and none matched.

An earlier version of this module implemented a JPEG-based format taken from
third-party documentation of this panel. That format is wrong for this
hardware, which is why images sent with it never appeared.

STILL UNKNOWN: how this payload is framed on the wire. Writing the bytes
straight to the serial port has not been shown to display anything. The vendor
sends it via `qt-tool/SerialPortTool.exe`, which takes three arguments and has
not yet been driven successfully, so a capture of the real framing is the
missing piece.
