# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `--color RRGGBB` sets every key's colour (opcode `0x23`).
- `--gap` to tune the inter-packet delay.
- RTC-set on the wired path, which previously refused to run.
- Confirmed key-id table: 84 keys, ids `0x00`–`0x7F`, row = high nibble and
  column = low nibble.

### Changed
- `protocol.py` now describes the wired `0C45:800A` path from a capture of the
  vendor app rather than from AULA F75 MAX prior art. Every builder was checked
  to reproduce the vendor's own packets byte-for-byte.
- Corrected: `0x28` is the RTC-set command, not session-prepare as previously
  assumed, and `0x02` is a commit that returns a 16-bit value, not a session
  finalizer. The cable path has no checksum byte; the 32-byte packet size and
  trailing checksum apply only to the (still untested) dongle path.
- The 64-byte RTC payload puts `AA 55` at bytes 62–63, not adjacent to the date
  as in the 32-byte F75 format.
- Dongle-path constants and builders are kept but marked as unverified guesses.

### Fixed
- Packets are no longer issued back-to-back: with no gap, the second data block
  of a transfer fails with `ETIMEDOUT` and replies are read before the device
  sets its ack bit.
- hidraw transfers now carry the required leading `0x00` report-id byte on the
  dongle path too; the device declares no Report ID item.
- `--handshake` no longer commits an empty session, which the device rejects
  with `0xFF` in the ack byte.
- `--send-hex` rejects over-length packets instead of silently sending them.

### Known gaps
- Effect selection, brightness and macros are still unknown. Effects run on the
  keyboard itself: the vendor app polls `0xF5` ~27x/s only to mirror the
  keyboard's current LED state in its preview.
- Opcodes `0x13` and `0x00`, and the meaning of the 16-bit value returned by
  the commit, are unidentified.
- Nothing on the dongle path has been tested against hardware.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `tools/aula_l99_hacky/`: Linux CLI for the AULA L99's vendor HID channel
  (`0C45:800A` wired, `05AC:024F` 2.4G dongle).
  - `device.py` — hidraw device discovery and a transport supporting raw
    read/write plus `HIDIOCSFEATURE`/`HIDIOCGFEATURE` for the cable's feature
    reports.
  - `protocol.py` — confirmed session handshake (`SESSION_INIT`/`SESSION_QUERY`
    on the dongle path, `CABLE_SESSION_INIT`/`PREPARE` on the cable path), the
    packet checksum (`sum(bytes[0:31]) & 0xFF`), and the RTC-set command
    builder.
  - `cli.py` — `--list`, `--handshake`, `--rtc`, and `--send-hex` (test a raw
    packet captured from the vendor driver against real hardware).
- Research writeup (`Windows/AULA L99/PLAN.md`) covering static analysis of
  the extracted vendor installer and prior-art survey: confirms the keyboard
  side (`0C45:800A`) uses the standard Windows HID API, the touchscreen is a
  *separate* `EEEF:268A` USB-serial device (not part of the keyboard's HID
  interface), and links the most relevant open-source reverse-engineering
  projects for this hardware family.

### Known gaps
- RGB/lighting effect commands and macro commands for `0C45:800A` are not yet
  captured or documented anywhere (including this project) — only the
  session handshake and RTC-set command are confirmed.
- No live hardware/Windows capture has been performed yet; everything to
  date is static analysis plus third-party prior art.
