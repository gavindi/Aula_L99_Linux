# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `tools/aula_l99_hacky/`: Linux CLI for the AULA L99's vendor HID channel
  (`0C45:800A` wired, `05AC:024F` 2.4G dongle).
  - `device.py` — hidraw device discovery and a transport supporting raw
    read/write plus `HIDIOCSFEATURE`/`HIDIOCGFEATURE` for the cable's feature
    reports.
  - `protocol.py` — confirmed session handshake (`SESSION_INIT`/`SESSION_QUERY`
    on the dongle path, `CABLE_SESSION_INIT`/`PREPARE` on the cable path), the
    packet checksum (`sum(bytes[0:31]) & 0xFF`), and the RTC-set command
    builder.
  - `cli.py` — `--list`, `--handshake`, `--rtc`, and `--send-hex` (test a raw
    packet captured from the vendor driver against real hardware).
- Research writeup (`Windows/AULA L99/PLAN.md`) covering static analysis of
  the extracted vendor installer and prior-art survey: confirms the keyboard
  side (`0C45:800A`) uses the standard Windows HID API, the touchscreen is a
  *separate* `EEEF:268A` USB-serial device (not part of the keyboard's HID
  interface), and links the most relevant open-source reverse-engineering
  projects for this hardware family.

### Known gaps
- RGB/lighting effect commands and macro commands for `0C45:800A` are not yet
  captured or documented anywhere (including this project) — only the
  session handshake and RTC-set command are confirmed.
- No live hardware/Windows capture has been performed yet; everything to
  date is static analysis plus third-party prior art.
